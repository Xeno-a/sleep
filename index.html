            <b>What Is Sleep: A Dynamic Activity</b> <br> <br>
Nerve-signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters control whether we are asleep or awake by acting on different groups of nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain. Neurons in the brainstem, which connects the brain with the spinal cord, produce neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine that keep some parts of the brain active while we are awake. Other neurons at the base of the brain begin signaling when we fall asleep. These neurons appear to “switch off” the signals that keep us awake. Research also suggests that a chemical called adenosine builds up in our blood while we are awake and causes drowsiness. This chemical gradually breaks down while we sleep. <br>
<br> <b>Phases of sleep</b> <br>
Like most other mammals, humans also show two types of sleep: <br>
1. Rapid eye movement (REM) <br>
2. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep <br>
Both these types of sleep have distinct features when evaluated using electroencephalogram or EEG. <br> <br>
<b>Dreaming</b> <br>
<b> Everyone dreams.</b> <br> You spend about 2 hours each night dreaming but may not remember most of your dreams.  Its exact purpose isn’t known, but dreaming may help you process your emotions.  Events from the day often invade your thoughts during sleep, and people suffering from stress or anxiety are more likely to have frightening dreams.  Dreams can be experienced in all stages of sleep but usually are most vivid in REM sleep.  Some people dream in color, while others only recall dreams in black and white. <br>  
<br> <b> Why You Need Sleep</b> 
If you have ever felt foggy after a poor night’s sleep, it won’t surprise you that sleep significantly impacts brain function. First, a healthy amount of sleep is vital for “brain plasticity,” or the brain’s ability to adapt to input. If we sleep too little, we become unable to process what we’ve learned during the day and we have more trouble remembering it in the future. Researchers also believe that sleep may promote the removal of waste products from brain cells—something that seems to occur less efficiently when the brain is awake. <br>
<br><b>Fact: </b>Your body cycles through four stages of sleep. The stages generally repeat about four to give times during a 7- to 9-hour sleep period. <br>
